# spring-cloud-learning
a demo project for learning spring cloud netfix

### problems ###
can't update config client though /bus/refresh

### remarks ###
use node1, node2 profiles to run SpringCloudRegistry in multi node mode
since zipkin server can not run with spring boot 2.0, so used spring boot 1.5.x in SpringCloudZipkinRegistry
